This note describes areas where implementation of keynav for panels was 
difficult.

- PanelWidget and objects on the panel such as launchers and applets need to
be focusable

Both the PanelWidget and objects on the panel need to be focusable in order
to invoke the context menu using only the keyboard. In the normal course of
things, GTK+ does not support a widget and its children be focusable.

Instead of requiring the PanelWidget be focusable we have introduced a key 
binding Ctrl+F10 which pops up the panel's context menu. So a PanelWidget 
is focusable only when it does not have any children. There is, therefore,
no need for the key binding Ctrl+Tab to move the focus to the PanelWidget from
an applet or a launcher.

The function panel_widget_real_focus is PanelWidget's default signal
handler for focus signal. This function is called when either PanelWidget 
or a child has focus and Tab or arrow keys are used to move focus. If the 
PanelWidget has focus and the PanelWidget has children the GTK_CAN_FOCUS flag 
is unset so that a child can receive focus.

- An applet with a tooltip receives focus

If an applet has a tooltip, the applet will receive focus so that the tooltip
can be displayed, even if the applet contains focusable widgets. The
focusable widgets in the applet can be traversed using the arrow keys.


- Tab should move focus from within an applet to the next object on the panel

This is implemented by defining an action signal "move_focus_out_of_applet"
on MatePanelApplet and binding Tab  and Shift+Tab to this action. 

When focus is in an applet the event is passed to the focus widget then its 
children until a toplevel is reached unless the event is handled. This is 
done in gtk_window_key_press_event(). The original implemementation  for 
"move_focus_out_of_applet" had the action signal defined on MatePanelAppletFrame 
but as a GtkSocket always reports a key press event as being handled when 
the GtkPlug is in a different process, the event has not passed to the 
MatePanelAppletFrame.

The implementation for "moving_focus_out_of_applet" sets a flag 
moving_focus_out so that the function mate_panel_applet_focus() which is 
MatePanelApplet's default signal handler for focus signal will not attempt to
move the focus within the applet if this flag is set.


- Implementing key bindings

If focus is in an applet which is in another process, the GtkSocket will 
report the key stroke as having been handled. This means that key bindings
will not be activated. The workaround for this is to handle those key
strokes in panel_event() a signal handler for the event signal in panel.c.
However, we only want to handle some keybindings, for example we do not want 
to handle Shift+F10, which displays the context menu, and Ctrl+F1, which 
displays the tooltip, but we do want to handle Ctrl+F10 which displays the 
panel's context menu.


- Focus indication

We need a mechanism that will make visible which panel has focus. We also
need to do this without impacting current behaviour.

We set the state of a PanelWidget to GTK_STATE_SELECTED whan focus is in a
PanelWidget. We provide a default panel rc file mate-panelrc, which is 
installed in $(datadir). This rc file sets the default default color for
SELECTED for any widget which is a descended from a PanelWidget or
MatePanelApplet to be the same as the NORMAL colour. 

If there is a requirement to make panel focus indication visible, the 
following lines added to ~/.gtkrc-2.0 will make a selected panel prelight 
color.

style "prelight-selected"
{
  fg[SELECTED] = { 0, 0, 0 }
  bg[SELECTED] = { 0xea60, 0xea60, 0xea60 }
}

widget_class "*PanelWidget*" style "prelight-selected"
widget_class "*MatePanelApplet*" style "prelight-selected"
