      <summary>Name to identify panel</summary>
      <description>This is a human readable name which you can use to identify a panel. Its main purpose is to serve as the panel's window title which is useful when navigating between panels.</description>
    </key>
    <key name="screen" type="i">
      <default>0</default>
      <summary>X screen where the panel is displayed</summary>
      <description>With a multi-screen setup, you may have panels on each individual screen. This key identifies the current screen the panel is displayed on.</description>
    </key>
    <key name="monitor" type="i">
      <default>0</default>
      <summary>Xinerama monitor where the panel is displayed</summary>

      <default>true</default>
      <summary>Expand to occupy entire screen width</summary>
      <description>If true, the panel will occupy the entire screen width (height if this is a vertical panel). In this mode the panel can only be placed at a screen edge. If false, the panel will only be large enough to accommodate the applets, launchers and buttons on the panel.</description>
    </key>
    <key name="orientation" enum="org.mate.panel.PanelOrientation">
      <default>'top'</default>
      <summary>Panel orientation</summary>
      <description>The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top", "bottom", "left", "right". In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded mode the difference between "top" and "bottom" is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave. For example, on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.</description>
